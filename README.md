## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During the coding process i struggled with some points. One of them was how to put two images in the HTML, showing one by time depending on the device witdh.
I've had it during my classes with the tag picture, but during the process i forgot about that possibility.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 651px)">
  <img src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="a perfume with leaves around">
</picture>
```

When talking about the CSS, I don't have a specific code I'm proud of, but I've learned how to use the element's window better, to find mistakes in my code during the process. Something I'm still learning but I'm really proud of.

### Continued development

I still have a long way on frontend development, praticing my HTML and CSS skills are the main way for it. Working for including some Javascript, React and others technologies in my stack soon.
